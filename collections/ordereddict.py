'''
A Python üêç OrderedDict is a dictionary remembering the insertion order of the keys.

Since Python 3.7 this behaviour is the default also for standard dictionaries.

But there still reasons to use OrderedDict.

1. performances: for high rates of insertions and popitem calls OrderedDict may be a better fit 

2. Intent signaling: using OrderedDict makes clear that the order of keys in the dictionary is important.

3. Controlling the order: the methods move_to_end() and popitem() can be used to reorder the keys

4. Equality test: OrderedDict is better to test dictionaries equality considering the order of the items

5 backward compatibility with versions of Python older than 3.6
